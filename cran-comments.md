## First submission
This is a resubmission of my first submission of this package to CRAN.
Issues with DESCRIPTION corrected.
Apologies for additional NOTEs in previous submission - these were
only on R-devel and I had missed the email with the report.

* local Windows 10 install, R 3.2.2
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.2.2
* win-builder (R-release and R-devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies
None at this time
